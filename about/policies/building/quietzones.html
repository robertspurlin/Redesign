    <h4><b>Quiet Zones</b></h4>
    <p>In response to student requests, the Library has designated Quiet Zones on the third and fourth floors of the Library.</p>
    <p><b>Quiet Zone Locations</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Third and fourth floors, beyond the elevators (including the computers). Look for the Quiet Zone signs in these areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Quiet Zone Policies</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No talking except the occasional whisper.</li>
      <li>Use headphones/earbuds to listen to music and videos, not your computer's speakers. Be aware that at high volumes, sound may "leak" from your headphones.</li>
      <li>No talking on cell phones. If you need to use a cell phone, please move to the area around the stairway.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>What to Do if a Quiet Zone is Too Noisy</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help us keep these zones quiet by reminding other students of their purpose.</li>
      <li>If you feel uncomfortable approaching noisy users, you can call for backup and a library staff member will investigate.
        <ul>
          <li>Contact a librarian through our chat service (below) and let us know exactly where the offenders are and give a brief description of them.</li>
          <li>Phone the Service Desk at (615) 898-2817 (option 1).</li>
          <li>Use the house phone near the elevators; choose option 1 when the recording finishes. Your call will be routed to the Service Desk.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

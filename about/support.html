    <p><b>Walker Library is where students get work done, and MTSU has a hardworking student body.</b></p>
    <p>Libraries have changed more in the past twenty years than at any other time in their long history. The changes have primarily been driven by the birth of the internet and the evolution of communication that has followed. The landscape of publishing and access to information has been redefined to emphasize electronic media for its ease of access effectiveness for research.</p>
    <p>Anyone who believes that libraries are unnecessary should spend some time in Walker Library. During the term, you would see a building bustling with students working at computers, studying together in a group study room or quietly reading and reviewing notes for their next class. Technology is everywhere—large digital signs, computers, scanners, and printers. Some of the technology is not so obvious such as specialized software for media editing and research software to search the most relevant articles from the thousands of periodicals. Behind the scenes, the library relies upon a host of computers, specialized software and global networks to supports the operations of the library.</p>
    <p>While technology is the engine that propels us forward, we have not lost the personal touch in any manner. Students find the Library as a safe haven. The faculty and staff of Walker Library provide expert assistance, instruction and even encouragement to students every day. We see students’ lives change as we work with them to complete their education.</p>

        <p>The Womack Curriculum Collection, located on the 3rd floor of Walker Library, is a specialized library collection in support of students and faculty within the College of Education. More than just books and materials, Curriculum has human resources too: subject experts who can help you with your research, locate what you need to write that paper or lesson plan, or give you guidance on your area of inquiry.</p>
        <p>Need a space to collaborate with others or work quietly? Curriculum can help with that too. Our entry area contains plentiful seating for quiet study. Group study rooms around the perimeter allow for collaborative work with others. All of our study rooms are equipped with computers to allow for optimal productivity.</p>
